      <h2>Who has time to be on Reddit all day?</h2>
      <p>
      Many Reddit posts get submitted throughout the day, and unless you can constantly check your reddit feed some content may be missed and buried by other submissions.<br /><br />

      Reddit Aggregator helps mitigate this problem by allowing you to create an account and submit a list of subreddits you enjoy. Reddit Aggregator will check the subreddits hourly and compile a list of entries throughout the day that match the subreddits you provide. These entries are bundled together into a nice readable format called a report. Users can have several reports for different purposes (each having their own set of subreddits).
